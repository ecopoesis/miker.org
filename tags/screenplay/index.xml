      <description>While I was looking for a nice reading copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark I discovered an old series of screenplays called the Premiere Movie Script Library. The defunct Premiere magazine published this series of screenplays of popular and classic movies. I was disappointed to find no information about the series on the web, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d put together what I found.&#xA;There were nineteen scripts published between 1994 and 1995.</description>
