      <title>ST7565 Success</title>

      <description>After much screwing around, I finally got the ST7565 working with the Arduino Due. The wonderful u8glib recently added support for the Due and had preexisting support for the ST7565.
I&#39;m still annoyed that I can&#39;t get the adafruit library to work on the Due. I&#39;m slowly porting bits of the u8glib SAM code path for the ST7565 over, but frankly I&#39;m just annoyed with displays at this point, so I&#39;m going to go on the something more interesting, like actually adding a clock to my alarm clock.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve spent the last several days unsuccessfully trying to get the ST7565 to work with the Arduino Due. I&#39;ve been trying to port ladyada&#39;s ST7565 library to the SAM core without much luck.
   Using the ST7565 with Uno and the library works with no issues, as would be expected, so I didn&#39;t fuck up soldering or anything easy to diagnose like that.
Getting the code to run on the Due is not as easy.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solder</title>

      <description>One of this things I knew I need to learn to build the world&#39;s best alarm clock was how to solder. And I was right: one of the first things I needed to do was solder wires to the ST7565 display I got from adafruit so I could hook it up to the Arduino at the heart of the clock.
Problem 1: I don&#39;t have a soldering iron. Some quick Googling show that there are a lot of cheap soldering irons out there, and that you can probably get away with using them if you&#39;re not doing a ton of work.</description>
