      <description>First print on the Replicator 2X After a long wait, my MakerBot Replicator 2X was finally shipped and came in. I’ve wanted a 3D printer for a long time (going back to the Cupcake days) and only this year was able to convince my wife that we “needed” one.
Two problems were apparent right away: no cover and no magnetic latch on the front door. Both of these are vital for keeping warm air around ABS, and keeping cats out in progress prints.</description>
