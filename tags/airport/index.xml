      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our house is old. City records show it was built in 1910, but that&amp;rsquo;s just the age the city assigned to all the housesÂ older then that. Our neighbors, who have a house that started life as a mirror image of ours, have found old newspapers in their attic from the 1870s making that our best guess for the age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases having an old house is great: structurally the house is solid. Big chunks of our house were built with old-school dimensional lumber from the era when a 2x4 was actually 2 inches by 4 inches. We have walls with 8x10 angled beams in them. Our basement has 2 foot thick field stone walls. In the 19th century folks built things to last.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
