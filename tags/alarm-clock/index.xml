      <title>ST7565 Success</title>

      <description>After much screwing around, I finally got the ST7565 working with the Arduino Due. The wonderful u8glib recently added support for the Due and had preexisting support for the ST7565.
I&amp;rsquo;m still annoyed that I can&amp;rsquo;t get the adafruit library to work on the Due. I&amp;rsquo;m slowly porting bits of the u8glib SAM code path for the ST7565 over, but frankly I&amp;rsquo;m just annoyed with displays at this point, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to go on the something more interesting, like actually adding a clock to my alarm clock.</description>

      <title>ST7565 and the Arduino Due</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last several days unsuccessfully trying to get the ST7565 to work with the Arduino Due. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to port ladyada&amp;rsquo;s ST7565 library to the SAM core without much luck.
   Using the ST7565 with Uno and the library works with no issues, as would be expected, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t fuck up soldering or anything easy to diagnose like that.
Getting the code to run on the Due is not as easy.</description>

      <title>Struggles With the Arduino Due</title>

      <description>One of the things I knew going into this project was that I wanted the alarm clock to be compatible with Arduino. Ideally I&amp;rsquo;m going to expose as many of the Arduino&amp;rsquo;s pins on the final product in an accessible way so people can slap on shields and extend the clock to make it better.
This then begs the question: which Arduino? I have both a Uno and a Due. While I like the simplicity, support and cost of the Uno, the Due seems more future proof.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solder</title>

      <description>One of this things I knew I need to learn to build the world&amp;rsquo;s best alarm clock was how to solder. And I was right: one of the first things I needed to do was solder wires to the ST7565 display I got from adafruit so I could hook it up to the Arduino at the heart of the clock.
Problem 1: I don&amp;rsquo;t have a soldering iron. Some quick Googling show that there are a lot of cheap soldering irons out there, and that you can probably get away with using them if you&amp;rsquo;re not doing a ton of work.</description>

      <title>Alarm Clocks Suck</title>

      <description>Crappy Sony Alarm Clock   All current alarm clocks suck. Go look at Amazon and see what I mean. The best appear to be the Sony designs, which look unchanged from mid-90s. Piles of buttons, no auto-setting of time, no modern technology. If you want something built this decade, the best bet is the iHome crap. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve seen these: the look like they&amp;rsquo;re designed by a blind man, they only support iPhones and iPods, and still aren&amp;rsquo;t all that high-tech.</description>
