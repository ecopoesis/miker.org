      <description>In the &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo;-Covid world, a lot of companies are forcing employees back to the office with the justification that remote work is missing the &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo; hallway and watercooler meetings.</description>

      <title>Premiere Movie Script Library</title>

      <description>While I was looking for a nice reading copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark I discovered an old series of screenplays called the Premiere Movie Script Library. The defunct Premiere magazine published this series of screenplays of popular and classic movies. I was disappointed to find no information about the series on the web, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d put together what I found.
There were nineteen scripts published between 1994 and 1995.</description>

      <title>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Credits - All Seasons Synced</title>

      <description>YouTube commenters have asked, so here are the combined credits for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Like with TNG the credits are synced around the logo.
  Deep Space Nine famously changed its theme song between seasons three and four. I&amp;rsquo;ve represented this by putting the early season theme in the left channel and the later seasons&#39; theme in the right. They don&amp;rsquo;t sound too bad mixed together but this gives the option of only listening to one or the other.</description>

      <title>Star Trek: The Next Generation Credits - All Seasons Synced</title>

      <description>A while back I was watching a lot of episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. As the cast changes over the show&amp;rsquo;s seven seasons, the opening credits also change and I wondered if I could sync the credits together to visualize how the changes worked.
  Finding a point to sync the videos was difficult. After trying a few different places I ended up using the moment the Enterprise first appears.</description>

      <description>After seven years of Wordpress, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a change. Welcome to my new Hugo-based blog. It&amp;rsquo;s static. It&amp;rsquo;s cool. I probably will continue to not update it.</description>

      <title>Building a better keyboard</title>

      <description>I want a better keyboard but my plea to the industry had no effect. Since no one would make one for me I built the keyboard myself. My main goals were:
 Standard split-QWERTY layout mirroring the Microsoft Natural Keyboards No number pad High quality mechanical switches Bluetooth and USB-C connections Plug and play (no-solder) microcontroller replacement  Layout Building a keyboard naturally starts with designing the key layout. I used the wonderful Keyboard Layout Editor to build a tweaked version of the classic Microsoft Natural Keyboard layout.</description>

      <title>This Old Smart House</title>

      <description>Our house is old. City records show it was built in 1910, but that&amp;rsquo;s just the age the city assigned to all the houses older then that. Our neighbors, who have a house that started life as a mirror image of ours, have found old newspapers in their attic from the 1870s making that our best guess for the age.
In some cases having an old house is great: structurally the house is solid.</description>

      <description>Over on Hacker News, there is a discussion about Atwood&amp;rsquo;s new keyboard. It looks nice, but it&amp;rsquo;s not my ultimate keyboard. So bored rich people out there, build me a better keyboard.
   First, it needs to be ergonomic. Microsoft has pretty much perfected this, so let&amp;rsquo;s start by copying their natural keyboard design. The basic wave shape and key layout of the current natural keyboards is great, especially since they fixed the layout of the navigation (insert/delete) cluster.</description>

      <title>Adventures in 3D Printing</title>

      <description>First print on the Replicator 2X   After a long wait, my MakerBot Replicator 2X was finally shipped and came in. I’ve wanted a 3D printer for a long time (going back to the Cupcake days) and only this year was able to convince my wife that we “needed” one.
Two problems were apparent right away: no cover and no magnetic latch on the front door. Both of these are vital for keeping warm air around ABS, and keeping cats out in progress prints.</description>

      <title>ST7565 Success</title>
      <link>https://miker.org/st7565-success/</link>

      <description>After much screwing around, I finally got the ST7565 working with the Arduino Due. The wonderful u8glib recently added support for the Due and had preexisting support for the ST7565.
I&amp;rsquo;m still annoyed that I can&amp;rsquo;t get the adafruit library to work on the Due. I&amp;rsquo;m slowly porting bits of the u8glib SAM code path for the ST7565 over, but frankly I&amp;rsquo;m just annoyed with displays at this point, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to go on the something more interesting, like actually adding a clock to my alarm clock.</description>

      <title>ST7565 and the Arduino Due</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last several days unsuccessfully trying to get the ST7565 to work with the Arduino Due. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to port ladyada&amp;rsquo;s ST7565 library to the SAM core without much luck.
   Using the ST7565 with Uno and the library works with no issues, as would be expected, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t fuck up soldering or anything easy to diagnose like that.
Getting the code to run on the Due is not as easy.</description>

      <title>Struggles With the Arduino Due</title>

      <description>One of the things I knew going into this project was that I wanted the alarm clock to be compatible with Arduino. Ideally I&amp;rsquo;m going to expose as many of the Arduino&amp;rsquo;s pins on the final product in an accessible way so people can slap on shields and extend the clock to make it better.
This then begs the question: which Arduino? I have both a Uno and a Due. While I like the simplicity, support and cost of the Uno, the Due seems more future proof.</description>

      <title>Learning to Solder</title>

      <description>One of this things I knew I need to learn to build the world&amp;rsquo;s best alarm clock was how to solder. And I was right: one of the first things I needed to do was solder wires to the ST7565 display I got from adafruit so I could hook it up to the Arduino at the heart of the clock.
Problem 1: I don&amp;rsquo;t have a soldering iron. Some quick Googling show that there are a lot of cheap soldering irons out there, and that you can probably get away with using them if you&amp;rsquo;re not doing a ton of work.</description>

      <title>Alarm Clocks Suck</title>

      <description>Crappy Sony Alarm Clock   All current alarm clocks suck. Go look at Amazon and see what I mean. The best appear to be the Sony designs, which look unchanged from mid-90s. Piles of buttons, no auto-setting of time, no modern technology. If you want something built this decade, the best bet is the iHome crap. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve seen these: the look like they&amp;rsquo;re designed by a blind man, they only support iPhones and iPods, and still aren&amp;rsquo;t all that high-tech.</description>
