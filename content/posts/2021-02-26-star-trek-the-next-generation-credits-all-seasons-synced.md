A while back I was watching a lot of episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation.
As the cast changes over the show's seven seasons, the opening credits also
change and I wondered if I could sync the credits together to visualize how the
changes worked.

Finding a point to sync the videos was difficult. After trying a few different
places I ended up using the moment the Enterprise first appears. She is after all
the star of the show. The Enterprise's appearance is also a sort of midpoint in
the credit's story: first we have the solar system, then the Enterprise and then
the cast. Since the Enterprise is consistent season-to-season it makes comparing
the variable parts easier.
