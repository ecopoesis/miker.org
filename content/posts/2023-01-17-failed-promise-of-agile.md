It's a tale as old as time. A company has a failing engineering organization. The blame, fair or not, lands on the companies engineering leader who is ousted. The company looks outside for a replacement. It finds a successful leader: someone who runs an organization that ships quality code, quickly and often. 

The new leader joins and assesses the mess they've inherited. The engineering organization is overrun with tech-debt. There are a few major refactors, rebuilds and replatforms going on, but all are half completed and none have an end date in sight. Teams don't coordinate with each other and each team seems to follow its own bespoke development process. Deployments are few and far between, and when they do manage to happen almost always need to be rolled back because of major bugs. A few charismatic and exceptionally loud developers have managed to build effective "teams" around them.
