### Crimson Tide
##### Give me a ping, Vasili. One ping only, please.
A good, not great, submarine movie. Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman act the shit out this movie, but that can't save a fundamentally flawed script. Hackman's captain is written as too evil and too wrong: despite trying to make both side seem reasonable, Hackman is obviously in the wrong. *Crimson Tide* would be 100x better if Denzel wanted to release the missiles (he would be a by the book, follow orders and not undertanding the real world new officer) while Hackman understands the nuiances and ambiguities presented by the real world, old salt that he is.

### Kursk
##### 5/5
Also called *The Command*, this is a much better submarine movie. A great example of smart folks working to overcome obstacles imposed by their superiors.

### K-19 The Widowmaker
##### 4/5
Harrison Ford graduated from CIA analyst to Russia submarine captain, and Joss Ackland went from the Soviet Union's American ambassador to Navy Admiral. After this and *Kursk*, I'm starting to get the feeling the Soviet/Russian government may not be the best run organization. Also, you have to love a movie that cold opens with an exercise/drill. Yeah they stole of from *Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan*, but that doesn't make it less awesome.

### 1917
##### 4/5
The one shot style is obviously a gimmick, but it's a gimmick that works well.

### The Pod Generation
##### 4/5
Absolutely zero submarines in this movie, yet somehow still enjoyable. Emilia Clarke's eyebrows are a national treasure and deserve an Oscar. Also this moview has nine (__NINE!__) studio intros. Guess I missed the day they passed around the hat.

### Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
##### 5/5
Absolutely zero submarines in this movie, yet somehow still a submarine movie. A really, really good submarine movie. How we didn't get a franchise out of this I'll never understand, though maybe not having to sit though *Master and Commander: Too French Too Furious* makes it okay.

### Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.
##### 5/5
Absolutely zero submarines in this movie, yet somehow the best submarine movie (sorry *Red October*). Also the best *Moby Dick* movie.

### Hollywoodland
##### 2/5
Completing the Eddie Mannix duology with a much worse movie. *Hollywoodland* is suposed to be a period piece (two peroids actually) but always feels like it was filmed in the late 90s. It is slow and boring.

### Margin Call
##### 4/5
If you can get past the Kevin Spacey-ness, this is great movie. Covers the same ground as *The Big Short* but in a much less condescending manner.

### Sunshine
##### 1/5
*Sunshine* has so much going for it: great concept, great cast, good music. And then Danny Boyle fucks it all up by making it nearly impossible to watch. Stop being clever Danny: point the camera the actors and let them act. What a mess.
