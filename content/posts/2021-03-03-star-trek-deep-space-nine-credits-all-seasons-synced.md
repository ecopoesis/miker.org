YouTube commenters have asked, so here are the combined credits for Star Trek:
Deep Space Nine. Like with
[TNG]({{< ref "posts/2021-02-26-star-trek-the-next-generation-credits-all-seasons-synced.md" >}} "Star Trek: The Next Generation Credits - All Seasons Synced") the credits are synced around the logo.

Deep Space Nine famously changed its theme song between seasons three and four.
I've represented this by putting the early season theme in the left channel and
the later seasons' theme in the right. They don't sound too bad mixed together
but this gives the option of only listening to one or the other.

I think I've captured all the in season changes: the wormhole getting discovered
after the first episode and Ezri's promotion early in the final season. I'm sure
if I missed any the commenters will let me know.

The most interesting thing I found was that even though the theme changes, the
overall length of the credits is the same. I had always felt like the faster
theme meant shorter credits.
