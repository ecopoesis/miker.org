While I was looking for a nice reading copy of _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ I
discovered an old series of screenplays called the Premiere Movie Script Library.
The defunct [Premiere magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere_(magazine))
published this series of screenplays of popular and classic movies. I was
disappointed to find no information about the series on the web, so I thought I'd put together
what I found.

There were nineteen scripts published between 1994 and 1995. Below they are
listed in the order they appear in the editions published later.

In general the Premiere Movie Script Library editions are pretty nice. Each
has a short introduction to the film from _Premiere_'s editors. They end with
glossy stills from the films and publicity photos.

The scripts I've read so far appear to be shooting scripts: they have minor
differences from the filmed versions. Some have been broken into scenes and shots.

Annoyingly not all of screenplays are single-sided. Reading double-sided scripts
is maddening. The covers, while cool looking, are impractical. They are made of
a relatively thin cardstock with a hole cut to show a movie poster underneath.
This makes them almost impossible to read without ripping as can be seen in
my poor copy of _Rocky_.
