](http://miker.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0353.jpg)After much screwing around, I finally got the ST7565 working with the Arduino Due. The wonderful [u8glib](http://code.google.com/p/u8glib/)Â recently added support for the Due and had preexisting support for the ST7565.

I'm still annoyed that I can't get the adafruit library to work on the Due. I'm slow porting bits of the u8glib SAM code path for the ST7565 over, but frankly I'm just annoyed with displays at this point, so I'm going to go on the something more interesting, like actually adding a clock to my alarm clock.
